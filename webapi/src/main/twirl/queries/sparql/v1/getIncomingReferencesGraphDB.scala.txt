 * Gets information about the incoming references to a resource, as well as about the referring resources.

 * This template is used only by getIncomingReferences.scala.txt.
 *
 * Since the triplestore type is GraphDB, we assume that inference is enabled, and we use it to optimise the generated
 * SPARQL. Specifically, we use inference to return search results matching subproperties of Knora base properties
 * such as knora-base:hasLinkTo. This requires us to use GraphDB's GRAPH <http://www.ontotext.com/explicit>
 * whenever we need to get explicit (non-inferred) statements.
